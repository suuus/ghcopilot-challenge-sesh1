# GitHub Copilot Challenge Session

Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Challenge! This session is designed to help you practice and explore the capabilities of GitHub Copilot within VSCode.

## Overview

This challenge consists of three progressive exercises that will help you understand how to effectively use GitHub Copilot's in-editor suggestions. You'll work with:
- Data structures
- Algorithm implementation
- API integration

## Time Allocation
- Total time: 20 minutes
- Recommended time per challenge: 6-7 minutes
- Extra time for exploration: 5 minutes

## Getting Started
1. Open each challenge folder in order (01-data-structure, 02-algorithm, 03-api)
2. Read the instructions in each challenge's README.md
3. Complete the challenges using GitHub Copilot's suggestions
4. Try to rely on natural language comments to get the best suggestions

## Challenges
1. [Challenge 1: Stack Implementation](./01-data-structure/README.md)
2. [Challenge 2: String Manipulation](./02-algorithm/README.md)
3. [Challenge 3: Weather API Integration](./03-api/README.md)

## Tips for Success
- Write descriptive comments about what you want to achieve
- If you don't like a suggestion, press `Alt + ]` to see the next one
- Use `Ctrl + Enter` to explicitly request suggestions
- Try breaking down complex problems into smaller parts with comments

Good luck! ðŸš€
